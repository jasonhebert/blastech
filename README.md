Blastech Steel Plate Requisition
========

This is an old project I worked on for Northrop Grumman Ship Systems in 2003.

The application was an XUL based interface that ran in Mozilla XULRunner. All interactivity implemented in JavaScript.

The application facilitated requisitioning of steel plate material from a vendor based on material forecast data to support JIT material support.
